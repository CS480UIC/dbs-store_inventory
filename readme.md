# Database description
The goal of the project is to help grocery stores cut down on throwing out food that could otherwise be donated. The data that will be stored in the database is the item SKU, item aisle, and item expiration date. For all parts of the project the system will be web based. It is different from other inventory management systems because the sole purpose of this is to remind users of expiration.
